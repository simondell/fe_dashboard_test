Tools used: iterm, zsh, safari (for research), chrome (for testing), git, github (repo and issues), node, npm, webpack, emmet, webpack-dev-server, babel, react, postcss/css-next, d3, react-faux-dom

Editor used: SublimeText3 & vim for commit messages (I enjoy the brutal chess of vim but have yet to configure it with all the tools I'd want for dev)

Additional comments (optional):

Time taken includes researching a lot of tech:

- remind myself of React lifecycle functions
- learn webpack almost entirely from scratch including configuring it for using Babel, css & postcss
- learn css-modules and webpack's involvement with those
- basics of d3. I'd started on a tutorial series before working on this project, but had to finish that before being able to do anything in this project
- tried to get Jest working for tests but hit several snags and gave up:
	- failed to understand the interaction of webpack, jest and css-modules (i vaguely got how you need to mock up webpack's styles import and the className replacement, but didn't understand how to accomplish it)
	- didn't know what to test - it's been 15 months since I last tested a React component and I forgot all the patterns and practices (plus the codebase I last did this in had loads of helper tools and patterns already configured which wouldn't apply and weren't accessible).
